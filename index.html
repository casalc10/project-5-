      <h1>My programming journey</h1>
      <p>I have designed this webpage to show the many different coding skills i have learned.
         My story becoming a developer is honestly a rollercoaster.
          My story started when i watched my father code for his job as a kid.
         I then join amazon and seen they have a program i jumped straight to the opportunity.<strong>body</strong> 
         I have always been one to pick up new things pretty quickly.
          When it came to schooling i have always stayed in the cosmetology industy but have always been intrested in coding.
           I have talked to a few people who are software developers and what they enjoy most about it is the challenges they face everyday.<strong>p</strong> 
           To be able to do this as a career excites me because the challeneges and puzzles i face already durin the program have pushed me to keep going. 
           So with being new to this type of technology, my webpage will change consistently.
          This webpage shows how much i have learned and how much a will learn to become a software devoloper.</p>
